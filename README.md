## Description

The Compact and Broadband Planar Magic-T is a novel design implemented on a 0.25 mm thick RT Duroid 6010 substrate with a dielectric constant of 10.2. It utilizes microstrip structures with microstrip to slotline transitions to achieve a broadband response, minimizing radiation losses and insertion loss.

## Features

- Utilizes quarter-wavelength (λ/4) microstrip lines for circular structure
- Microstrip-slotline transitions for reduced insertion loss and improved bandwidth
- Implementation of complementary circular slotlines for broadband response
- Compact design with low footprint and high bandwidth
- Radial stub and stepped matching microstrip line for impedance transformation and improved bandwidth
- Achieves 5.2 GHz bandwidth with 1-2 isolation >10 dB, phase imbalance <1°, amplitude imbalance <0.25 dB, and E-H isolation >34 dB

## Structure

The proposed structure consists of a magic-T ring structure with three ports (1st and 2nd ports forming coupling arms, and the 3rd port at the top end) and a 4th port (E-port) connected through an impedance transforming circuit.

## Design Parameters

The resulting design is compact, with dimensions of 6.24 mm x 8 mm x 0.25 mm (0.41λ x 0.53λ x 0.02λ), providing an ideal response at 7.6 GHz. Design values are shown in Table 1.

## Design Optimization

- Complementary circular slotline for broadband response and improved reflection
- MS-SL transitions for large port E-H isolation and good phase transitions for even and odd mode behavior

## Performance

The proposed design achieves a bandwidth of 5.2 GHz (68.42%), 1-2 isolation >10 dB, phase imbalance <1°, amplitude imbalance <0.25 dB, and E-H isolation >34 dB.

## Applications

The proposed magic tee finds applications in broadband operations in defense and wireless communications.
